**Please make sure to run the script with administrator privileges (on Windows: Run as Administrator, on Linux/macOS: use `sudo`),**  
otherwise, the program may not capture keyboard events properly and won’t work as expected!

- Right-click on your terminal (Command Prompt / PowerShell) and choose **Run as Administrator**.
