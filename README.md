‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTE ‚ö†Ô∏è

PLEASE RUN THE SCRIPT WITH ADMINISTRATOR/ROOT PRIVILEGES TO ENABLE PROPER KEY LOGGING FUNCTIONALITY.  
WITHOUT THESE ELEVATED PERMISSIONS, THE PROGRAM WILL NOT CAPTURE ANY KEYBOARD EVENTS.

---

WHY?  
Key logging requires low-level access to keyboard events that normal users usually don‚Äôt have.  
Running as admin/root allows the program to listen to all system keyboard events.

- Run Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator (Right-click ‚Üí Run as administrator).  
- Then run:  
  python "Keyboard Typing Behavior Analyzer.py"

LINUX / macOS:
